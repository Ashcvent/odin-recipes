        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Mangú is a traditional Dominican dish made from boiled green plantains that are mashed to a smooth, slightly chunky consistency. 
            <br>Typically, the plantains are softened by boiling, then mashed with butter, olive oil, or the water they were boiled in, resulting in a creamy yet hearty texture.
            <br>Mangú is usually served as part of a classic Dominican breakfast called Los Tres Golpes, which includes fried eggs, fried cheese, and salami, often accompanied by pickled red onions for a tangy contrast. </p>
